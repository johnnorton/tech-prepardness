Tech Security and Continuity

This is an interesting time.  COVID-19 time to be exact.  As we have looked at our physical security in terms of food and health, now would be a good time to review our technical security.

I recently had a friend that their phone was destroyed.  They bought a new phone and discovered they have had little to no backups.  In this case the phone is repairable and we (hopefully) can get the data back but there is a cost in time and money that will have to be paid.

This document is designed not to be a “checklist” per se, but more of an outline of situations I have encountered over the years.   Please look at each one and see if it applies to you.  If it does review it and put in place a disaster plan.  And finally I don’t believe in backups, I believe in restoring backups.  This means that just because it is backed up does not mean it can be restored.  You need to test your backups to make sure they work.
